<title>AS3: Resource Management pt 3</title>
<description>In this third part of my series on resource management in AS3 I will be focusing on a few new tools in AS3 that let you track and manage memory more effectively. There are only a couple new "official" features that are specifically geared towards resource management, but they are very useful. These are supplemented by a handy unofficial feature...</description>

<title>Mac Text Navigation Keyboard Shortcuts</title>
<description>I thought that with so many developers switching to Apple hardware, it would be useful to post a quick run-down on the awesome text shortcuts in OSX. It likely contains some that even long time Mac users aren't aware of. This is hardly an exhaustive list, but these are the ones I use regularly...</description>

<title>AS3: Singletons</title>
<description>In ActionScript 3, class constructors can only be set to public, which leaves AS3 developers without a clear way to implement the Singleton design pattern. Luckily, there are a couple ways of faking Singleton functionality. Both solutions are kind of hack-ish, but they get the job done...</description>

<title>AS3: Dictionary Object</title>
<description>Dictionary is a new object type in ActionScript 3 that allows you to associate a value with an object key...  different references to the same object will act as the same key... You can also set a Dictionary to use weak references as keys... This can be a very handy tool... Note that there is one known bug with Dictionary...</description>

<title>AS3: Weakly Referenced Listeners</title>
<description>I would very strongly recommend getting in the habit of ALWAYS setting your listeners to be weakly referenced. It's easy to use weakly referenced listeners in AS3... So please (PLEASE!), get in the habit of always setting your event listeners to be weakly referenced...</description>

<title>Flex 2 from a Flash Developer's Perspective</title>
<description>I've been tinkering around with Flex, and while I still don't feel as comfortable with it as I do with Flash, I do feel like I have a good grip on when and why I would use it. Being that this is a subject that a lot of Flash developers seem curious about, I decided to post my thoughts. Flex 2 is an amazing tool for building a specific type of project...</description>

<title>AS3: Resource Management pt 2</title>
<description>This article will focus on the implications some of the new features of AS3 have on resource management, and the potential headaches they could cause you even in simple projects. Resource management is going to be an important part of AS3 development. Ignoring the issue could result in sluggish content, and potentially stalling users' systems completely.</description>

<title>Understanding the Delete Keyword.</title>
<description>Cedric Nehemie asked a great question about why using delete on a property of a sealed (non-dynamic) class throws an error in ActionScript 3, and whether it will delete the actual object in memory.There isn't a lot of documentation on this topic, so the following is mostly just conjecture and interpolation from related exploration, but I think it is fairly accurate...</description>

<title>AS3: Resource Management pt 1</title>
<description>With great power comes great responsibility, and this will be very true for AS3. I will look at the underlying mechanics of the Garbage Collector, discuss the problems you are likely to face, examine the new tools available to you for handling resource management in AS3, and offer solutions/code to help you circumvent many of the common problems you will face...</description>

<title>Types in AS3: ints not so fast, uints slow!</title>
<description>I did some quick testing on the performance of numeric types, which confirm Sho's assertion that int is only slightly faster than Number in ideal circumstances, but the results from uint were much more surprising.</description>

<title>Adventures with Adobe and an Intel Mac - Part 1</title>
<description>I recently decided to purchase an intel Macintosh for my main work system, despite there being no native binaries for the software that I use most often: Macromedia Flash and Adobe Photoshop... So, I jumped in head first and bought a Macbook... so far it's been working absolutely beautifully... My plan for the system is to run most of my apps in...</description>

<title>Using a Static Proxy to a Singleton With Events</title>

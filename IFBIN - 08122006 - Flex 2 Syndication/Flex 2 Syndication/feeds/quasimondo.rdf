    <title>FilterForge Beta</title>
    <description>If you like patch based tools and experimental visuals you might want to check out FilterForge a new Photoshop plugin which also works as a standalone application.

Currently it's in beta and you can register at their site to apply for a free evaluation copy.</p>

<p>FilterForge allows you to create all kinds of textures or effects by simply connecting various functional modules with "cables" - a system that is very common in a lot of 3d software or visual programming tools like max/msp or Quartz Composer.</p>

<p>Some features that I find very interesting are: the resulting patterns can be made seamless, they can be up to 32000x32000 pixels in size and there is an optional intelligent antialiasing algorithm that smoothes out jaggies at high contrast edges.</p>

<p>You can share the filters and effects that you build on the FilterForge website and if you deliver good ones that many others find useful you can even get FilterForge for free.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A last tip: if you happen to be in Toronto and you read "Kids & Explosions" on a flyer someday - you have to go to that party. Josh is absolutely awesome and I really hope to get the chance to see (or rather hear) him again.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <title>New at the Incubator: Minority Cube</title>
    <description>If you&apos;ve seen the movie Minority Report you probably remember the impressing gesture based computer interface that Tom Cruise uses there. Well, my latest experiment is far from the sophistication of that tool, but for it being made with Flash it&apos;s quite nice and entertaining: Minority Cube allows you to control the rotation of a cube on the screen by simply moving your hand in front of your webcam.

I'm looking forward to see <a href="http://www.ninapaley.com">Nina Paley's</a> Flash animation talents and I'm very anxious to see <a href="http://www.liquidjourney.com">Gary Stasiuk's </a>two sessions. And there are many more great presenters - <a href="http://www.flashconference.de/program/program.overview.html">check them all out here</a>.</p>

<p>And now for another tradition - well, maybe it's a bit early to call it like that already - but as the headline says I'm in the lucky position to raffle two four-day tickets for the fmx, each worth 185 Euro. I will give them to two different people (so it's not two tickets for one winner). In order to win, all you have to do is send an email to <b>fmx2006@quasimondo.com</b> and list your personal <a href="http://www.flashconference.de/program/program.overview.html">top 3 sessions of the flashconference</a>. On Monday, April the 17th I will randomly draw the two winners.</p>

<p>Something like a disclaimer: The tickets will ony be valid for the two winners and cannot be sold or transfered. There is no compensation in money possible. The winner will only get the ticket, there is no accomodation or travel expenses included. Oh yes - and of course it would be fair towards the others if you only take part in this raffle if you are able to attend.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <title>Flash 8: Realtime Video Color Keying</title>
    <description>My previous experiment with the selective color transforms made me think a bit more about creating masks from colors and its applications. I wondered if it is possible to use a similiar technique to calculate green screen or blue screen masks in realtime for Flash video. And indeed - it works.

I wondered if it is possible to use a similiar technique to calculate green screen or blue screen masks in realtime for Flash video. And indeed - it works. </p>

<p>I've programmed a keying technique similar the <a href="http://designer.pri.ee/after_effects/1_21_84_0.html">Color Difference Key</a> known from AfterEffects or other video editing programs. This kind of keying allows for finer control and better transitions than for example a simple chroma key.</p>

<p>A very important factor for successful keying is good lighting of the fore- and background and as I don't have a studio at hand for this demo I allowed myself to use the example clip from this <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/flash/articles/talking_head_video.html">Macromedia Video Tutorial</a> featuring <a href="http://www.tomontheweb.ca">Tom Green</a> - I hope that's okay for this purpose. I've converted the original 20MB quicktime movie to a 1 MB FLV (wow, isn't that on2 codec great?) - and there is definitely no more alpha channel in there. Alternatively you can try to use your webcam, but if you don't have good lighting and a decent background the results will be only so-so. But I can imagine that the same technique could be used for example on still images to mount peoples' heads on avatars.</p>

<p>Here is the demo:<br />

    <title>Flash 8: Selective Color Transform</title>
    <description>I was asked if my ColorMatrix Class can be used to change only a certain range of colors within a bitmap. Well, that&apos;s mathematically not possible, but nevertheless there is a way to make this work with Flash - it just needs a few more steps and some temporary helper bitmaps. In short it works like this - if you only want to change the orange parts of an image you first isolate those parts by replacing all other colors with 100%transparent pixels, then you apply the ColorMatrix filter to it and finally draw it over the original bitmap.

<p>In short it works like this - if you only want to change the orange parts of an image you first isolate those parts by replacing all other colors with 100%transparent pixels, then you apply the ColorMatrix filter to it and finally draw it over the original bitmap.</p>

<p>Here is the part of the code that creates a mask from a given color range - as you see I'm using several consecutive threshold commands for every color channel.</p>

<pre>mask.threshold( original, rect, zero, "<", rmin<<16,0,0x00ff0000,true);
mask.threshold( mask, rect, zero, "<", gmin<<8,0,0x0000ff00,true);
mask.threshold( mask, rect, zero, "<", bmin,0,0x000000ff,true);
		
mask.threshold( mask, rect, zero, ">", rmax<<16,0,0x00ff0000,true);
mask.threshold( mask, rect, zero, ">", gmax<<8,0,0x0000ff00,true);
mask.threshold( mask, rect, zero, ">", bmax,0,0x000000ff,true);
		
mask.threshold( mask, rect, zero, "==", 0xff000000,0xffffffff,0xff000000,true);
</pre>		

<p>I have expanded the concept a bit and added a few tools to clean up and adjust the resulting mask. Check out the demo here:</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <title>The Good News and the Bad News</title>
    <description>You&apos;ve probably read it all over the blogs today - Microsoft has discovered a security vulnerability in the Flash Player which seems to affect almost every version. The good news is that Adobe has published a fix already. And it sounds to me like you really shouldn&apos;t wait too long to make that update - it might become quite ugly out there in case someone finds out how to make use of this exploit.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<br><br>You've probably read it all over the blogs today - <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/916208.mspx">Microsoft</a> has discovered a <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/apsb06-03/">security vulnerability in the Flash Player</a> which seems to affect almost every version. The good news is that Adobe has published a fix already. And it sounds to me like you really shouldn't wait too long to <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/apsb06-03/">make that update</a> - it might become quite ugly out there in case someone finds out how to make use of this exploit.<br><br>

I see two possible consequences out of this issue, as soon as this news hits the mass media:<br> 
a) Panic - people disable their Flash Plugins alltogether<br>
b) Chance - 99% penetration rate for Flash Player 8 within weeks<br>
<br>
Of course I am an ambassador of alternative b - especially as it is the much more logical consequence - ultimately the exploit has already been found and been fixed - it's not some unknown danger lurking in the depths of your system. All you have to do is spend maybe 2 minutes for the update. How about doing it right now - I've prepared a little ExpressInstall swf which should do the magic almost automatically - if it doesn't ask you to update and shows you "Flash Player 8.0.24.0 installed" you are fine. (If you are beta testing the new 8.5 player you'll have to tread a bit more carefully for a while).<br><br>


<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.quasimondo.com/flashobject.js"></script>
<div id="flashcontent"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
	var fo = new FlashObject("http://www.quasimondo.com/updateflash.swf", "updateflash", "300", "200", "8.0.24.0", "#ffffff");
fo.write("flashcontent");
</script>

<br>Of course this will only update your browser plugin. For the standalone player, the debug player or other version you should consult the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/apsb06-03/">Macromedia update page</a>.<br><br>

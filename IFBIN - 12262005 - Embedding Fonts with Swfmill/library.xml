		The id attribute is the name of the font you can use with a TextFormat object.
		Import specifies the location of the font file. It can be absolute, like the example
			below, or relative to the folder the SWF is in.
		Glyphs allows you to specify which characters you want to you embed. Here we are only
			using a few. By specifying the exact characters you want to use, you can save space
			because you aren't including the whole typeface.
			
		Note: Bold, Italic, and Underline styling typically appears in seperate font files.
			You should check your fonts directory for the exact name of the font required.

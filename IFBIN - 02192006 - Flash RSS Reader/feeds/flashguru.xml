			<content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>Who&#8217;s that <a href="http://richardleggett.co.uk/blog/index.php/2006/02/10/adobelaunchsoho" target="_blank">strange man in the background</a>, and what&#8217;s with those dots? Dust on the lense maybe.</p>
	<p>This is Me, Tink, Grant and Bobbi in Waxy O&#8217; Conners fulfilling our appetite before the Adobe Launch Party. Steak for me and Bangers and mash for Grant <img src='http://www.flashguru.co.uk/wp-images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
	<p>We arrived at the launch party at just after nine, by which time the apparently dull keynote had long been forgotten and the drinks were flowing at the free bar. The free bar being the place were us and the rest of the Flash Envoy conveniently located ourselves for the rest of the evening.</p>
	<p>I was interested to hear from some of the other attendees that the only mention of Macromedia or Macromedia Products in the whole of the keynote was that the aquisition had closed, which is fair enough i guess considering it was a party for the launch of Adobe Production Studio which doesnt include any of the Macromedia products, but still a little strange since they invited a bunch of Flash dudes.</p>
	<p>I felt a little out of place amongst all these presumably photoshop/after effects users and me and Grant were saying it was pretty weird going to an event and not knowing many people. The venue was a gay bar, Rich Leggett came suitably dressed with pinkish stripey shirt and all and the music was along those lines aswell for most of the night (Madonna et al), although it did pick up in the last hour or so, at which point the empty dancefloor became a pit of jeering, swaying half-cut Adobe employees and others, which was hilarious to watch from above in a drunken gaze.</p>
	<p>The little Flash Envoy at the party consisted of in no particular order, <a href="http://www.gskinner.com/blog/" target="_blank">Grant Skinner</a>, Me, <a href="http://www.richardleggett.co.uk/blog/" target="_blank">Richard Leggett</a>, <a href="http://www.flasheurope.com" target="_blank">Stewart McBride</a> (Temporarily), <a href="http://www.flashant.org" target="_blank">Aral Balkan</a> (For a little while), <a href="http://www.tink.ws/blog/" target="_blank">Tink</a>, <a href="http://www.flashcoder.net/blog/" target="_blank">Sean</a>, <a href="http://blog.bittube.com" target="_blank">Dave Williamson</a>, <a href="http://www.flashgen.com" target="_blank">Mike</a>, <a href="http://www.woodan.org/blog/" target="_blank">Daniel Brown</a> and some other guys from AKQA. Was nice to meet Dan and Mike with whom ive never spoken before, both top blokes.</p>
	<p>All in all a good night, but the highlight of the night, for me was when the Flash Envoy on leaving the event decided to &#8220;borrow&#8221; the Adobe Marketing Product Boxes which were left behind on the stage and conveniently re-erect a pyramid structure outside one of the Adult Sex Shops in Soho for a <a href="http://blog.flashgen.com/images/photos/alp/alp013.jpg">group hug</a>.</p>
	<p>Till next time. More piccies <a href="http://blog.flashgen.com/?p=50" target="_blank">here</a>.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>This year ive chosen to skip the lure of the <a href="http://www.flashforwardconference.com" target="_blank">FlashForward</a> conference that has moved location to Seattle and instead i  will be heading over to Sydney at the end of February to <a href="http://www.webdu.com.au/go/session/introduction-to-the-image-api" target="_blank">present a seminar</a> about the new Image API in Flash 8 for the <a href="http://www.webdu.com.au/">webDU conference</a> (previously MXDU). </p>
	<p>This will be the third year in a row that ive braved the 24 hour monster of a flight to hang out with the Aussie Flashers and present at the conference. Ive said it before, and ill say it again, webDU is an awesome conference! My favourite of all the conferences ive been to and this year is shaping up to be even better than it was last year. Checkout <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/flashguru/sets/233147/">last years photos</a>.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.tink.ws/blog/" target="_blank">Tink</a> and <a href="http://www.lordalex.org/" target="_blank">LordAlex</a> will be joining me this year to show the Aussies how to drink beer and party properly <img src='http://www.flashguru.co.uk/wp-images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  and im thinking that we will probably visit Tokyo or Hong Kong on the way their for a couple of days, to break up the flight and hang around for 10 days or so after the conference to enjoy Sydney.</p>
	<p>Hope to see you there.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>People that know me, know that i used to smoke like a chimney, 20 Marlboro Lights a day for 6 years, ouch!! Well, this year as with the last couple of years, my new years resolution is to stop smoking. </p>
	<p>However, this year, ive actually gone for it big time. On New Years Eve around 11:30pm i ran out of ciggies, so didnt bother to buy anymore and haven&#8217;t smoked one since.</p>
	<p>That&#8217;s now a whopping full week (7 days). Ive done it, and im now going to stay stopped. I feel much better already and i have joined the local gym and started a protein/creatine diet (something ive always wanted to do). </p>
	<p><img src="http://www.flashguru.co.uk/images/no-smoking.jpg" border="0"/></p>
	<p>I can actually smell things now and taste my food which is great, although i am eating *alot* of food, 5 meals a day at the moment.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>Earlier at <a href="http://www.cesweb.org/" target="_blank">CES</a>, Google announced the launch of the <a href="http://pack.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Pack</a>, an auto-updating software download service (kind of like Windows update), that is apparently &#8220;as easy to use as it is to visit the google homepage&#8221;. </p>
	<p>You can choose which software to install and naturally it includes all the Google applications (Earth, Desktop, Talk, Toolbar, Picasa etc..) it also includes the Firefox browser and free/lite versions of some of my favourite third party apps, namely: Norton Antivirus, Ad-Aware and Trillian (Surely this is a conflict of interests, with Google Talk) all of which i already payed for and own (DOH!!)</p>
	<p>Most worryingly it also includes Adobe Reader 7 (A hefty download) and the nagware/bloatware of a video player that we know as the Real Player but yet most suprisingly there is no Flash Player???! <img src='http://www.flashguru.co.uk/wp-images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
	<p>I would have expected to see Flash Player up amongst the rest of those third party app&#8217;s/plugins, especially since Adobe Reader is included amongst the collection. Hopefully Macromedia were and now Adobe will continue to work hard to get the Flash Player included in the Google Pack, this could be a great way to get the Flash Player out to a massive audience, faster! And of course get people to upgrade quicker aswell. Anyone with me on this one?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>Ive had myself a nice break, the end of which is quickly approaching. I spent the Christmas with family, and as luck would have it, most of the UK saw a decent amout of snow fall on Boxing Day! One day late, but this is the first time in a good five or six years that we have had some nice snow (enough for me to build a large snow man and women). </p>
	<p>I hope that everybody else has had a wicked Christmas. Ive enjoyed almost every minute of it (other than the hangovers - ouch!!)</p>
	<p>2005, like 2004 has been a great year for myself and my company, in 2006 we will be expanding, new offices, new corporate site and new staff. So cheers to everybody, heres to another great year!</p>
	<p>Lets not forget that 2005 was a terrible year for natural disasters, terrorism and war and im hoping that whatever we did as people to piss off the gods (whoever yours may be), is forgiven, i think they have had their revenge on us this year.</p>
	<p>All the best. Back next year.

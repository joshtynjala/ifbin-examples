		<description><![CDATA[If a web site contains asynchronous calls or doesn't work like a regular webpage in some way, it's being labeled with the notorious Web 2.0 tag. Regardless of my feelings about the hype surrounding it, I believe that we're actually seeing a preview or teaser of what we'll really consider a second version of the [...]]]></description>

After creating half a dozen different mockups, I finally came up with the look you see now. I may tweak it a bit [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As anyone who has read Slashdot knows, mentioning Flash is a good way to get people angry. Among the ultra-devout tech crowd, Flash has one of the worst stigmas imaginable. When I read comments on Slashdot, and even on Digg, I want to scream at the closed-mindedness. These people slammed the doors shut years ago, [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recently downloaded the Opera Web Browser so that I could use it for testing some pages I'm working on. Did you know it's totally ad-free now (and doesn't cost a penny)? Me either. Anyway, as I was playing around with its weird interface, I discovered "Small Screen" mode in the View menu. Suddenly, the [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Many wisely chose to wait before putting Flash 8 content on the web. For a business, blocking a large portion of your customer base is a bad idea. As I'm sure you've read, Adobe recently released their first Flash Player 8 version penetration data. Now, 8-ball sits on about 50% of machines out there. The [...]]]></description>

All the buzz about AJAX and the comeback of JavaScript made me pick up DOM Scripting by Jeremy Keith. Though not quite the same calibre as the previous book, Friends of ED delivers an [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google released an interesting study about the content of over a billion webpages in their database. It's nicely seperated into categories of markup, and identifies the most used HTML tags and attributes. I found the comments on the most frequent mistakes very interesting. Obviously many tags are used incorrectly for presentational (instead of semantic) purposes, [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you didn't see it, Tink posted a nice little overview of a couple things you can do with function parameters in AS3. I knew about default params from my experience with other languages, but I find the "..." keyword very intriguing. It lets a function receive any number of optional parameters. The function accesses [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I've had problems with Flash's Inspectable tag in the past, I still actively use it in my daily component development. With highly complex components, Inspectable let's me finish property definition quicker, and I can spend less time messing with details in the FLA. Just today, I discovered something that speeds things up even more, [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A lot of established companies have undertaken major identity changes recently. Changing a logo, especially for a company or brand recognized around the world, is no small decision. This small symbol acts as the core of any sort of recognition, and once it's firmly in the public's mind, changing it changes everything.
